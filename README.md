# SpacePirates ðŸš€
## APCS Final Project - Spring 2018

### Introduction
Based off the popular 90â€™s game, Oregon Trail, Space Pirates is the spin-off version in space! It is the year 3392. Nuclear wars, global warming, and plagues have made Earth virtually uninhabitable. Technology has enabled scientists to communicate with a planet 400 light years away with a creatures of a highly developed intelligence. Those creatures, Gomples, have kindly agreed to aid human kind in search for a new home. Luckily, scientists have discovered that the dwarf planet Pluto just so happens to be sustainable to life now! Your mission is to take a small team of Humans and Gomples to Pluto and begin colonization. However, you must survive the perilous journey there first.

### System Requirements
Eclipse IDE 4.4 and Java 8
	
### How to Play
The goal of Space Pirates is to reach Pluto which is 7 billion kilometers away. Starting with a level one ship, the user is faced with scenarios that may either further or slow down progress to Pluto. Some scenarios include raids, merchant ships, and even breeding between crew members (See ). The user must keep track of itâ€™s spaceshipâ€™s condition and repair the ship otherwise it cannot fly. When the user has obtained enough spare parts, they will have the option to upgrade the shipâ€™s level. Higher spaceship levels lead to higher speeds as well as higher chances for successful raids. 

### Game Setup
At the start of the game, the user inputs his or her name. To initialize the spaceship, the user must add 5 creatures, either a human or gomple, and give names to those creatures. The user must also choose food items to add to the ship. The three options are granola bars, alien meat, and pickle juice jars and must add up to no more than 20. All games start with a level one ship equipped with a barrier, cannon, fulstar plate, hyperdrive, laser, and powerflux capacitator. Cannons and lasers are used as weapons for raids. Barriers act as the spaceshipâ€™s protective shield. Powerflux capacitators, hyperdrives, and fulstar plates make up the spaceshipâ€™s interior engines. The user also starts off with $1000 to spend on equipment or food later in the game. 

### Playing the Game
 The main menu allows the user to check the distance to Pluto, ship conditions, food inventory, crew members, and to fly. After setup, a timer begins and the game keeps track of how far the spaceship has traveled by converting its speed. The user can view itâ€™s spaceshipâ€™s equipment status and spare equipment. If any equipment has zero health, the spaceship is broken and cannot fly or engage in raids unless it is repaired. The user should keep track of equipment status and buy spare parts when necessary. Flying is where all of the scenarios occur. Different scenarios have different probabilities.
 
 Each scenario has a different action that may require the user to do something, or the scenario will simply play our by itself. The consequences of each scenario may further or delay the spaceshipâ€™s mission to Pluto.  One of the most common scenarios is raiding. The user can decide if he or she would like to raid another ship. If the spaceship is broken, the user cannot raid. Successful raids are based on the spaceshipâ€™s success level and luck. Higher spaceship levels mean higher success rates. A random number generator generates either one, two, or three numbers (based off the shipâ€™s level). A raid is only successful if and only if all numbers are less than the shipâ€™s success rate. A successful raid results in more equipment, food, and money. Unsuccessful raids result in damage to the ship and a decreased success rate. 
 
 Following every scenario, the spaceship comes across a merchant cruiser in which the user has the option to purchase either a food item or equipment. After every scenario, the game checks if the spaceship can upgrade. A spaceship is upgradable if it has at least one spare for each equipment. Higher spaceship levels lead to higher speeds as well as higher chances for successful raids. There is also a probability of a love affair between crew members and the option for breeding. Higher levels have higher chances of breeding, which exhausts 5 spaces of food. 
  If at any point the ship is broken or has no crew members, the game is over. The game has been won when the spaceship reaches Pluto. A leaderboard shows the top players with the fastest times.
